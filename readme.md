## Link Anonymizer
###Anonymously visit links in YOURLS, including referring sites and original URLs.

Sometimes you want to click a link, but you don't want to have your YOURLS installation be the refferer. So you right click, copy the URL, paste it in your address bar. 

Instead, use Link Anonymizer to generate a link for you that will take you to an anonymizer service.

When you click the ![[anon]](https://raw.github.com/katzwebservices/YOURLS-Link-Anonymizer/master/key_go.png) link, you will be first redirected through an anonymous referrer service of your choice.

### What service should I use?
You can use any service&mdash;there are many&mdash;but here are some options:

* [https://linkonym.appspot.com](https://linkonym.appspot.com) (default)
* [http://nullrefer.com](http://nullrefer.com)
* [http://blankrefer.com](http://blankrefer.com)
* [http://refhide.com](http://refhide.com)
